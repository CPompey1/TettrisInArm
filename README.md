# TettrisInArm Project Description

TettrisInArm is an implementation of the classic Tetris game, written entirely in ARM assembly language. This project is designed to run on ARM-based platforms, providing a hands-on demonstration of low-level programming concepts and techniques. By building Tetris from the ground up in assembly, the project highlights the intricacies of direct hardware manipulation, memory management, and performance optimization that are often abstracted away in high-level languages.

## Features

- **Core Tetris Gameplay:** Includes all standard Tetris mechanics such as piece generation, movement, rotation, line clearing, and scoring.
- **User Input Handling:** Processes real-time keyboard or button inputs to control the falling tetrominoes.
- **Graphical Output:** Renders the game board and pieces using low-level drawing routines, showcasing how graphics can be managed without external libraries.
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Demonstrates careful use of registers and memory, optimizing for speed and minimal resource consumption.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Organized into logical modules for game logic, input, output, and utility functions, making the codebase easier to understand and extend.

## Educational Value

TettrisInArm serves as an excellent learning resource for those interested in:

- Understanding ARM assembly language and instruction set architecture.
- Exploring how classic games can be implemented at the hardware level.
- Gaining insight into efficient programming practices for embedded systems.
- Learning about direct memory access, stack management, and interrupt handling.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need an ARM emulator or a compatible ARM development board. The code can be assembled and loaded using standard ARM toolchains. Detailed build and run instructions are provided in the projectâ€™s README.

## Conclusion

TettrisInArm is both a fun and challenging project that bridges the gap between software and hardware. It demonstrates that even complex applications like games can be realized with a deep understanding of assembly language, making it a valuable reference for students, hobbyists, and professionals interested in low-level programming.
